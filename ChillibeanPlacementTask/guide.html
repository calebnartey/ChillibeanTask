                        <p>Each team in F1 has a pair of drivers that competes against other pair of drivers to help the team
                            to earn the title of 'best team in F1'. Each driver of a team will individually earn points so that
                            they collectively earn points for their team. Over the recent years, Mercedes AMG Petronas Motorsport
                            has won the 8 Constructors Standings over the last 8 seasons.
